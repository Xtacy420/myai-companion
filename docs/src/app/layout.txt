File: src/app/layout.tsx
Role: Root Application Layout

Description:
This is the main layout file for the entire Next.js application. It defines the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags that wrap every page, ensuring a consistent structure and style across the app.

Key Responsibilities:
- Sets up global fonts (Geist Sans and Mono).
- Imports and applies global CSS styles from `globals.css`.
- Defines application-wide metadata for SEO (title, description).
- Configures the viewport for responsive design and mobile web app capabilities.
- Wraps all page content with necessary providers.

Imports & Exports:
- IMPORTS:
  - `Geist`, `Geist_Mono`: Custom fonts.
  - `globals.css`: Global stylesheet.
  - `ConvexClientProvider`: **[OUTDATED]** A wrapper for the now-removed Convex cloud backend.
  - `Script`: Next.js component for loading external scripts.
- EXPORTS:
  - `metadata`: Default SEO metadata.
  - `viewport`: Viewport settings for responsiveness.
  - `RootLayout`: The main layout component.

Data & State Management:
- This file does not directly manage application state.
- It previously integrated `ConvexClientProvider`, which managed the connection to the cloud database. This is no longer in use.

Critical System Connections:
- UI System: Absolutely critical. This file is the foundation for the entire UI.
- Auth System: **[CLEANUP REQUIRED]** Contains the `ConvexClientProvider`, a leftover from the old authentication system. This needs to be removed and replaced with any necessary providers for the new local-first authentication system.
- Memory & Sync: No direct connection, but the outdated provider was the entry point for these systems.

Actionable Items:
- **High Priority:** Remove the `ConvexClientProvider`. It is a non-functional leftover from the previous architecture and could cause issues.
- Confirm if a new provider is needed for the local-first architecture (e.g., for global state management or database access).
